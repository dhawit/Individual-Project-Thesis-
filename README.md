Adaptive e-learning systems personalise learning using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This study designs, develops, and discusses an adaptive e-learning system that offers instructional materials based on user preferences and learning styles to promote individualised learning. The system customises information for each student, promoting engagement, learning, and inclusivity. Traditional educational methods sometimes fail to fulfil students' needs, resulting in a universal approach that might leave many behind. In contrast, adaptive e-learning systems use student performance and behaviour data to change the learning route in real time. This continuous feedback loop identifies strengths and weaknesses, allowing targeted academic performance improvements. Machine learning algorithms and approaches used to produce adaptive e-learning are examined in the thesis. By researching these tactics, the study seeks to create sophisticated algorithms that dynamically adapt educational material. This personalisation fosters an inclusive, impartial education where all students may achieve, regardless of preferences. When the system offers personalised, challenging suggestions, students are motivated and learn better. By tailoring learning to all students, regardless of starting point, personalised learning experiences improve engagement, learning outcomes, and inclusivity. The technology enables studentsâ€™ study at their own speed and targets problem areas with tools to remedy them. Data helps the system learn and adapt, improving personalised suggestions. Despite its advantages, adaptive e-learning systems are challenging to develop. These include the challenge of creating algorithms that properly interpret learner data and the need for data privacy and security. Scalability and performance for high-volume data processing are crucial. Adaptive e-learning systems must overcome these difficulties to succeed. The research suggests increasing the system's instructional materials and activities, using more sophisticated AI approaches, and studying adaptive e-learning systems' impact on varied student populations over time. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) might make learning more engaging. Data privacy and security and collaborative learning must be addressed in future research. This research concludes that AI and ML may create personalised, engaging, and successful adaptive e-learning systems. These strategies may personalise education, according to the research. As technology progresses, adaptive e-learning systems will personalise instruction for future pupils.
